## General info
This project was created by myself to get used to the GitHub environment, and for learning the proper way to document work, make commits, and push from my local machine onto the GitHub website. This is also the place I'll place files for code snippets that are meant to test how certain features work, or just for general testing purposes.


## HelloWorldC
A small C program meant to print out hello world when run from the terminal
```
$ gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c
$ ./hello_world
```
